## March 21

Found a table of ECAC data to scrape and came up with a name for my R package (ecacr). Read some portions of "creating an r package" book from Dr. Higham.

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Got a simple hello world function working and set up a lot of documentation and testing stuff. Started on scraping data and turning that into a package function. 

## March 23 End of Class

Got team_stats scraping function working, working on exporting that properly so I can start playing around with the stats in a separate rmarkdown. Looking to start get some good visualizations to know what I want users of the package to be able to make.

## March 28 Beginning of Class

I got swamped with other work and life stuff so I was not able to work on my project over the last 5 days. Plan for today is to start playing around with some visualizations and hopefully creating a lollipop plot function or something. 

## March 28 End of Class

Got team_stats() fully functional (minus error checking and testing). Got a mostly working lollipop chart going in a separate playground document, moving forward plan is to get it implemented into the package and add a bit more customization. 

## March 30 Beginning of class

Error checked and tested for teamStats(). base lollipopChart function is working in package. declared dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Casually chatted with Dr.RLock about learnr.

## March 30 End of Class

Developed scatterplot function, some helper functions (check variable names, titleCase)

## April 4 Beginning of class

Implemented basic tests for lollipopChart and scatterplot functions (based solely on dimensions). I think I also attached dependencies correctly!! Not positive though. 
TODO scrape individual lineup statistics
