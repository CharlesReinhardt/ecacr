Found a table of ECAC data to scrape and came up with a name for my R package (ecacr). Read some portions of "creating an r package" book from Dr. Higham.

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Got a simple hello world function working and set up a lot of documentation and testing stuff. Started on scraping data and turning that into a package function. 

## March 23 End of Class

Got team_stats scraping function working, working on exporting that properly so I can start playing around with the stats in a separate rmarkdown. Looking to start get some good visualizations to know what I want users of the package to be able to make.
